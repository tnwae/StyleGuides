# Common Style Considerations for All Languages

The following rules hold true for all languages in which we conduct development at Dreamacy Digital Development.

* Method names should be verbs.

* Variable, object, type, and class names should be nouns.

* Global and class-scope constant names should be spelled in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.

* Class names should be spelled in PascalCase.

* An indentation width of four characters is required.

* Spaces must be used instead of tabs.

* The maximum line width is 100 characters.

* Deviations from this style guide are not allowed for any reason.  If you wish to deviate from the style guide, you have to write your own.

* Where relevant and suitable, standard design patterns should be followed, as in the famous Gang of Four book.
